spinning up the process as we begin the project, we create react app, ver 13.5.3
  npx create-react-app@13.5.3

choosing the configs, we simply run 
  npm run dev

removing the existing template, we dont need:
rafce page.tsx in app,
editing global.css
same with tailwind.config.ts
and updating fonts in layout.tsx, adding weights
adding navbar component in the body of the layout.tsx

creating navbar as welll placing it inside components, which we later import in the layout.tsx 

we added navbar in the layout itself, cause navbars, headers and footers all usually stay the same through the entire website so we can just share them instead of always having to create it again n again :)

later we reconfig the public folder with new assets containing images and icons, gonna add them as we first use them.

adding stylings and actually creating navbar now.
working in the navbas.jsx file

next we create the home.tsx page, adding the head section for the homepage, heroCarousel, searchBar, and the Trending section text marks, that will be build step wise step one by one

moving on to the searchBar first, creating searchbar.tsx component and updating its UI.
next we move to the heroCarousel, working on its UI: 
  for this we use: 
    npm install react-responsive-carousel

https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive-carousel

adding code from the usage code snippet in the website

we reconfigure the images to the images we gonna add from local machine and add props to the carousel now, referencing how to do that from the link above.

again, the user can interact with this carousel, hence, we need to add "use client" on the top in order to fix all the errors :)

next we add a arrow pointing towards the link text entry field, only visible when te website is landscape-ish

adding the interaction functionality of the serachBar
making it check if the url entered belongs to the hostname amazon or not
and disbaling the button if the field is empty.
